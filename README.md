# Technical Test Repository

This repository contains the technical test delivery for analyzing and investigating anomalies in network traffic. It includes scripts and data used to detect unusual patterns in network traffic, identify potential malicious activities, and provide insights into possible security threats.

## Files

- **[Technical Report](./Technical_Report.md):** A detailed analysis of the dataset and the investigation of anomalies in the network traffic.
- **[Solution Proposal](./Proposed_Solution.md):** A document outlining the proposed solution based on the findings and how to mitigate the identified security risks.

Feel free to explore the scripts and reports to understand the investigation process and results.
