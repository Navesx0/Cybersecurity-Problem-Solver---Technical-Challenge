# Security Policy to Mitigate Identified Risks

Based on the information gathered through the analysis of the [Technical Report](./Technical_Report.md), we can develop some methods to mitigate or prevent the risks associated with the potential attack techniques outlined in the report.

## Comprehensive Security Policy

To develop a security policy that can be implemented to block or limit malicious traffic in order to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack, several points need to be addressed in the policy.

1. **Filtering Suspicious IPs**  
   **Criterion**: Monitor IPs that make an excessive number of requests per unit of time.  
   **Action**: Block IPs that exceed a certain threshold of requests per second or minute, using dynamic blacklists (e.g., with the use of fail2ban or iptables).  
   **Integration**: Use the firewall system to automatically block suspicious IPs after analyzing the traffic pattern.

2. **User-Agent Analysis**  
   **Criterion**: Check the frequency of requests from certain user agents.  
   **Action**: Identify and block outdated or fraudulent user agents. The policy can allow only modern user agents or block them when certain limits are reached.  
   **Integration**: Systems like Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or reverse proxies can be configured to analyze and block requests with suspicious user agents.

3. **Detection and Mitigation of Anomalous Traffic**  
   **Criterion**: Identify traffic spikes in short intervals or with high concentrations of requests to specific URIs.  
   **Action**: Implement real-time anomaly detection algorithms, such as time-series analysis or machine learning-based models, to identify unusual traffic spikes. The system can apply traffic limits for certain IPs or geographic regions.  
   **Integration**: Traffic monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) can be configured to detect and alert on traffic spikes. Suspicious traffic can be filtered or diverted to a DDoS mitigation environment.

4. **Geographical Filtering**  
   **Criterion**: Requests originating from unexpected or suspicious countries or regions.  
   **Action**: Create a list of trusted countries or regions and block requests from unauthorized or out-of-client-base regions.  
   **Integration**: IP geolocation systems (like GeoIP) can be used to enforce these restrictions.

5. **Detection and Blocking of Automated Traffic**  
   **Criterion**: Identify automated traffic patterns, such as regular spikes at specific times.  
   **Action**: Apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn normal traffic patterns and identify anomalies based on volume variations and request patterns. The solution can block or limit automated traffic based on predictive behavior.  
   **Integration**: Algorithms like Isolation Forest or K-Means can be used to train models that classify traffic as automated or legitimate.

## Example of Implementation

As a basic outline of a script that can be developed and implemented for traffic filtering, we have:

```python
import time
import json
from collections import defaultdict
from geoip import geolite2
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Initializing data
suspected_ips = defaultdict(int)
suspected_user_agents = defaultdict(int)
traffic_history = []
ml_model = IsolationForest()

# Request limits per IP, User-Agent
REQUEST_LIMIT = 100

# Function to identify suspicious IPs
def check_suspicious_ip(ip):
    if suspected_ips[ip] > REQUEST_LIMIT:
        return True
    return False

# Function to check User-Agent
def check_user_agent(agent):
    if suspected_user_agents[agent] > REQUEST_LIMIT:
        return True
    return False

# Function for geographic verification (example with GeoIP)
def check_location(ip):
    match = geolite2.lookup(ip)
    if match and match.country != 'BR':  # example of allowed country
        return True
    return False

# Function to detect automated traffic with ML
def detect_automation():
    ml_model.fit(traffic_history)
    anomalies = ml_model.predict(traffic_history)
    return [idx for idx, label in enumerate(anomalies) if label == -1]  # -1 indicates anomaly

# Main traffic processing function
def process_traffic(traffic_data):
    for data in traffic_data:
        ip = data['ClientIP']
        agent = data['ClientRequestUserAgent']
        timestamp = data['EdgeStartTimestamp']
        suspected_user_agents[agent] += 1
        suspected_ips[ip] += 1
        
        if check_suspicious_ip(ip) or check_user_agent(agent) or check_location(ip):
            print(f"Blocking traffic: {ip}, {agent}, {timestamp}")
            continue  # Ignore suspicious traffic
        
        traffic_history.append([ip, agent, timestamp])
    
    # Detect automation
    anomalies = detect_automation()
    if anomalies:
        print(f"Automated traffic detection: {anomalies}")
        # Mitigation actions can be taken here, such as blocking or redirecting traffic

# Example traffic data
traffic_data = json.loads('''
[
    {"ClientIP": "192.168.1.1", "ClientRequestUserAgent": "Mozilla/5.0", "EdgeStartTimestamp": 1612151700},
    {"ClientIP": "192.168.1.2", "ClientRequestUserAgent": "Windows 98", "EdgeStartTimestamp": 1612151800}
]
''')

process_traffic(traffic_data)
```

## Resources and Improvements
To improve the detection of anomalous traffic and prevent attacks, integration with other technologies and methodologies can be considered, such as:

1. Integration with AI/ML: Traffic analysis can be enhanced with supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, such as using Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks to predict attacks, not just anomalies in volume, but also in behavioral patterns.

2. Automation of Responses: The policy can be automated through tools like AWS WAF, Cloudflare, or Nginx with custom rules to block malicious traffic in real-time.

3. Adaptive Responses: The system can be configured to automatically adjust its blocking criteria based on traffic intensity. This can be done with dynamic learning-based rules that adjust limits as traffic changes.
